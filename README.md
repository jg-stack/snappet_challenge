### About

This project was completed to demonstrate frontend techniques without the need for a UI library.

However, in order to demonstrate what a library can do, I implemented for the first time [Victory JS](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/) as a graphing library.

### Improvements

One of the hardest parts of the challenge was not 'biting off more than I could chew'.  Therefore there is a lot more I'd like to configure and add to the project.

1. extend the overview page with a date picker to allow users to view different days
2. add re-select to allow caching from selectors
3. add sorting to the Daily Logs table
